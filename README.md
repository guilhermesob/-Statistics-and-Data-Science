# Statistics-and-Data-Science
This repository contains a collection of projects, analyzes and exercises focused on Statistics and Data Science. The main objective is to apply statistical concepts and techniques to data analysis, using modern programming and machine learning tools.

## Objective

This repository serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my understanding and experience in **Statistics** and **Data Science**, applying analytical methods to solve real-world problems. The content includes:

- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, estimates, confidence intervals, regression, and statistical inference.
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` to create visualizations that help uncover patterns and trends in the data.
- **Data Processing**: Techniques for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation to ensure data quality before analysis.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Implementation of statistical models such as linear and logistic regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and machine learning methods (both supervised and unsupervised).

## Repository Structure

- `statistics/`: Contains scripts and notebooks related to classic statistical techniques, such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, probability distributions, and regression models.
- `data_science/`: Contains notebooks demonstrating the application of **Data Science** methods on real-world datasets, covering everything from data cleaning to predictive modeling.
- `machine_learning/`: Examples of machine learning algorithm implementations, including classification, regression, and clustering, applied to various datasets.
- `visualization/`: Scripts and notebooks focused on how to present data clearly and effectively, using different types of charts and interactivity.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Python**: The main language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly**: Tools for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for implementing machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting and presenting analyses interactively.
